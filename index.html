        <p>In 2003, the musical Avenue Q charmed its way into the hearts of Broadway-obsessed individuals all over the world. As early as 2004, it gained unintended fame in the form of a meme when it’s song,“The Internet is for Porn” was <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-internet-is-for-porn">repeatedly reproduced</a> using <i>World of Warcraft</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, and various animes as the main characters singing the song.  </p>

        <p>In the song, the character Kate sings about her love for the internet while her male friend, Trekkie, persistently interjects “for porn” at the end of her lines. The lyrics are essentially this:</p>
        <span class="lyrics">The internet is really really great<br>
(for porn)<br>
I’ve got a fast connection so I don’t have to wait<br>
(for porn)<br>
There’s always some new site<br>
(for porn)<br>
I browse all day and night<br>
(for porn)<br>
It’s like I’m surfing at the speed of light<br>
(for porn)</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/avenueq/theinternetisforporn.htm">Etc.</a></p>
        <p>Kate is convinced that Trekkie’s obsession is a unique quirk, until all of her male friends appear and join in on the singing. Kate is disgusted by them. End scene.
</p>

        <p>One reason why this song, in particular, has resonated with audiences is that a LOT of people are watching porn all of the time. Pornhub has an insights team that regularly publishes the details of their metrics. According to their  <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review">review of 2017 data,</a> there were 28.5 billion visits to Pornhub. That averages out to 81 million visits per day. And this is JUST for the site Pornhub, which doesn’t include all of the zillions of other sites and resources for porn that exist (not exclusive to porn sites. Tumblr has a pretty expansive network of pornographic blogs, and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99ACxX9GQtI ">cam girls have been known to use SnapChat to make money.</a> There are probably plenty of other examples of the exploitation of otherwise harmless sites/networks.)
</p>
        <p>
        According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Generation-P-Youth-Gender-Pornography/dp/8776841898">Generation P? Youth, Gender and Pornography</a>, a book focusing on the introduction of pornography and its effects on Nordic youth, 92% of respondents to a survey reported being introduced to porn. (Page 89) Participants were between the ages of 12 and 20, from Sweden, Denmark and Norway. 99% of the boys reported being introduced while girls were only minimally behind, at an average of 86% having seen pornography before. (Page 89)</p>

        <p>Although they don’t state at what age they think or found children were introduced, they confirm that they were well below the age of consent and viewed it before having intercourse for the first time. (Page 90) As to be expected, boys viewed pornography more often than girls, with the figure almost inverse between the genders: girls are more likely to watch less frequently, while boys are more likely to watch more frequently (especially as they get older). (Page 92) 80% of participants were not discussing pornography, in general, with their parents.(Page 95)</p>
        <p>
        This is all coming from an area of the world that is much more progressive in how it treats adolescent sexuality. It would be inaccurate to take this data and say that it applies to American teens. There are different laws in action and different societal attitudes at play.</p>
        <p>
        In addition, none of these studies can actually prove that introduction to pornography is harmful towards adolescents. As the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/sunday-review/does-porn-hurt-children.html">NYT puts it</a>, “Let’s leave aside the difficulties of finding porn-innocent teenagers. Exposing them to sexually explicit material is against the law, which means no university would approve of such a study. And what if it turned out that pornography is harmful to teenagers?” It is unethical to find out, which means that we cannot conclusively prove the harm done. </p>

        <p>However, as the author David Segal also notes via an interview with Professor Reid, a research psychologist at UCLA , children must be educated about sex and relationships before they have access to porn. He thinks that at the minimum, parents should be covering this material with their kids during their teenaged years, if not earlier. “Putting a computer in a kid’s room without any limits on what can be viewed, he said, is a bit like tossing a teenager the keys to a car and saying: ‘Go learn how to drive. Have fun.’”</p>

        <p>
        Children turn to the internet when they have questions, same as anyone else. With smart phones in their hands and web connectivity 24/7, if they want to know something, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/kids-google-it-or-ask-parents-and-teachers/">it’s less likely they’ll seek it out from their parents.</a> On the one hand, this is potentially relieving to many parents who typically get a million “why” and “how come” questions a day. On the other hand, this leads to being influenced by what the internet has to show them. We return to a reprise of “The Internet is for Porn.”</p>
        <p>
        Children wonder about many things, especially when there’s something they don’t know that their friends do. Imagine being confused about a phrase, term or word used by a peer and wanting to understand what it means. Imagine turning to Google to find out the answer. Imagine coming up with unsafe search results and clicking on a link to pornography, either intentionally or not. This work flow of seeking an answer and landing on pornography as a viable result is concerning. What’s more concerning is the lack of information given to students to combat this new “knowledge” and be critical of what they are viewing. </p>
        <p>
        Kids are not getting this information in time at home. Estimations say that children younger than 10 are regularly exposed to pornography.(Segal, NYT). So, if this is the case, why is it that sex education in the United States is as awful as it is? </p>
        <p>
        In the late 1990’s, sex ed in the US plummeted to a singular approach of “AOUM,” also known as abstinence only until marriage. 49 of the 50 states accepted funding to teach this method to students, and subsequently failed at delaying sexual activity and preventing sexually transmitted infections. The attitude, as it appeared to kids, was quoted very nicely in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5xkxTfVLSA">“Mean Girls,”</a> “Don’t have sex, ‘cause you will get pregnant and die! Don’t have sex in the missionary position, don’t have sex standing up... just don’t do it, promise?” In fact, as of 2017, sex education was only required in 25 states (+ DC) <a href="https://nursing.usc.edu/blog/americas-sex-education/">and only 13 states require that sex ed be “medically accurate.” </a> The statistics on including information on contraception, HIV information, and LBGTQ+ topics are much more dim. On top of it all, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426905/">87% of schools allow for children to be excused from the lessons by their parents (Hall et al, 2016).</a> </p>

        Although sex ed in schools has been steadily declining, and parents are steadily involved (or not, as the case often is), the birth rates and the use of contraception. The research suggests that students are getting the information anyway, but from the internet rather than their parents or teachers. (Hall et al, 2016). There are suggestions that there are better online resources for this information: Planned Parenthood, Scarleteen, StayTeen, etc. However, there is also good ol’ Pornhub, RedTube, xHamster, etc. So long as teenagers know their way around the security settings on their various wifi networks and devices, both kinds of sites are equally easy to find.
